<li>Hacking Websites: Serious damage can be done to a company if successfully hacked. Companies and police are always on the lookout for hackers that are trying to illegally break into servers or steal valuable data from others. Punishments for being caught doing so can range from simply a fine, to many years in prison.
<li>Bullying: There are many people on the internet who use their communication access to harass others. They will insult, harass, and even hack others on the internet solely because they enjoy doing it. Bullying is a crime and can cause serious damage to victims, with far too many committing suicide to escape the bullying.
<li>Age Authentication: Every website has a set of terms and agreements that must be agreed upon for a user to create an account. Most of which require the account owner to be of 13 years of age or to verified by an adult. Unfortuneately, most people disregard this and lie instead. This can cause problems if there is legal trouble involving the website and the account owner's illegitimate account.
<li>GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation is a European Union enforced set of regulations designed to protect people's private information. It restricts information that websites can collect and puts an emphasis on getting the proper consent to aquire information from people.
