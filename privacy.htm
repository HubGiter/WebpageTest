<li> Phising: Fake websites and spam emails will try to steal your private information. Websites will be coded to look like important, legit websites like: Instagram, Snapchat, Ebay, Amzon, and so much more. Fake lookalikes of the websites will get you to input your private account information, then they will have access to information like your account and password, and even your credit card information.
<li> Cookies: Websites ask you to enable cookies so that they can record information. They will record things like whatever you type in and click on, your ip adress, computer information, and any other data they can collect. This data is then sold to companies that provide it to advertising companies. Allowing them to display ads specifically targeted to anything and everything you do on the internet.
<li> Cameras: It is very easy for hackers to gain acess to a webcam or a laptop camera. They can then turn it on to watch through it and record you or anything that the webcam sees. Many webcams have weaknesses or flaw in their design that makes them easy to remotely acess and turn it on. It is recomended to cover up laptop camera's while not in use, either with a small piece of paper or by purchasing a small cover that can slide over and off of the camera to allow easy access and privacy.
<li> Targeted Advertising: webisites will record your data and purchase it from companies to target you with advertisements specifically for you. For example, searching up a lot about cars and looking at many car dealership websites, will incent companies to target you with adertisemets for new car models.
<li> Microphones: Many companies are accussed of turning on people's phone microphones and listening in to people's conversations. Facebook has met backlash for displaying adversisements about subjects after consumer's talked about it while their phone was near. Many believe it was because Facebook was listening in through the phone's mircophone. Anyone could be listening in through your devices unless you take the proper precautions.
