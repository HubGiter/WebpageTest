<li>GPS: Global Positioning Systems can be enabled on phones to track your real time location. This can be useful when driving to get accurate directions that update as you try to reach a destination. They can also be handy for finding your mobile phone if you were to lose it. However, if this information isn't kept private, people will be capable of seeing exactly wherever you are whenever it is turned on.
<li>PED Cameras: Personal electronic devices equipped with cameras have allowed people to document anything anywhere. Whenever an event happens, people will take out their phones and devices to record it. As a result, whenever someone does something that could be considered wrong, there will likely be recorded evidence of their actions. Even if someone isn't doing anything wrong, there is always the chance that they are under surveillance.
<li> 911 Emergency Communication: Cellphone communications allow people to call for help almost whenever and wherever they need it. If there is an accident or emergency, people can call for help almost instantly and receive the aid they desperately need.
<li>PED's as Notebooks: Modern smartphones are essentially a computer in someone's pocket. They can be used to log important dates and set reminders to appear exactly when they are needed. People also can pull them out and type any small piece of information they need, like an address or a phone number.
<li>Cell Phones: Social life has drastically changed with instant communication. In today's world people can be reached in a matter of seconds and are usually expected to reply just as quickly. Information can be spread far more quickly than ever before, and people are more connected around the world than any other time in history.
